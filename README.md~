The purpose of this project is to summarize text. You can give the function a string,
or use the image to text function to get text to summarize. Also, the URLSummary function can parse 
the data from a url, and summarize it for you. Of course, the two functions that need 
to parse large amounts of data will inevitably take longer than if you give the summarize 
function text.
